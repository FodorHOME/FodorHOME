# FodorHome Water System

Arduino code for my smart Water System. Mobile app connection trough Blynk 1.0 legacy (now self-hosted).

Taking care of watering based on the weather and previous watering amounts (with a [little outside help](https://github.com/RedyAu/irrigation)), and cooling the house with the cold well-water before watering with it.\
I have written an analysis of this approach as a University Project (TL;DR: don't do this, it's not worth it) - you can read it in Hungarian [here](https://fodor.pro/kutklima.pdf).

The code is a bit of a bodge-job adapted and partly rewritten many times for then-current needs. For this reason, it is primarily for personal use, but feel free to adapt and reuse it with no restrictions.
